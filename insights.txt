1. The JPA specification requires that all persistent classes have a no-arg constructor
JPA Rules:
public or protected no-arg constructor must exist. Additional constructors are fine.
Persistent fields should not be public (protected, package visible and private are aloud).
Final persistent attributes or methods are not aloud.

2. You can pass the DTO to the logger and it will print its toString() method

3. We have three mechanisms that Spring Data JPA provides for querying data in a database:
    Query methods (convention methods)
    @Query annotation (with @Modifying for insert,update,delete)
    Custom repository implementation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30874214/how-to-access-entity-manager-with-spring-boot-and-spring-data


4. When Spring Boot finds an argument annotated with @Valid, it automatically bootstraps the default JSR 380 implementation — Hibernate Validator — and validates the argument.
When the target argument fails to pass the validation, Spring Boot throws a MethodArgumentNotValidException exception.

5. When you add new methods the dev server cannot pick it up. You have to restart manually.
