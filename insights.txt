1. The JPA specification requires that all persistent classes have a no-arg constructor
JPA Rules:
public or protected no-arg constructor must exist. Additional constructors are fine.
Persistent fields should not be public (protected, package visible and private are aloud).
Final persistent attributes or methods are not aloud.

2. You can pass the DTO to the logger and it will print its toString() method

3. We have three mechanisms that Spring Data JPA provides for querying data in a database:
    Query methods (convention methods)
    @Query annotation (with @Modifying for insert,update,delete)
